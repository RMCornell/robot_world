#Robot World

##Challenge
Spicy: Robot World

Create your own Sinatra app from scratch. This app should be a directory of robots. A robot has a name, city, state, avatar, birthdate, date hired, and department. Program the CRUD functionality for robots so that we can see all robots, see one specific robot, edit/update a robot, create a robot, and delete a robot. Can you use http://robohash.org/ and/or https://github.com/stympy/faker? Can you add a dashboard so that we can see statistical robot data? Eg: average robot age, a breakdown of how many robots were hired each year, number of robots in each department/city/state, etc.
